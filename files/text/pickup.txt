Conversation can be swimming along just fine until it hits a disagreement. These snags can damper or even end what was until then pleasant and potentially productive. Women in particular dislike disagreement. This is because, much more than men, women want to be in agreement with others (and especially with you if you've already established yourself as an authority). If you're having a friendly conversation with them and pleasantly disagree, the part of her brain that stresses consensus may actually reinterpret that to something workable for her worldview or moral sense. She also may broaden the borders of what she believes and how she believes it to incorporate what you believe. This, of course, is predicated on your approach. Nobody will work in the slightest to incorporate abrasiveness (unless you can somehow reverse it an make it funny).
Be careful as well that you don't confuse her pushing her own moral and ideological boundaries with her affecting agreement when she actually plans on badmouthing you later. There will usually be some sort of anger detectable below the second. Learning to read women in this way is essential (but don't take it too seriously).
